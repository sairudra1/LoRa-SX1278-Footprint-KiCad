# 📡 LoRa SX1278 Footprint & Symbol for KiCad

This repository provides a **schematic symbol** and **PCB footprint** for the  
**LoRa SX1278 module**, intended for use with **KiCad**.

It also includes an **example PCB** to help users understand footprint placement and usage.


## 📖 About the Repository

KiCad does not always provide ready-to-use libraries for popular RF modules like the **SX1278 LoRa module**.  
This repository aims to simplify schematic capture and PCB design by providing:

- ✅ A **fully verified schematic symbol**
- 📐 A **PCB footprint** (may require verification depending on module variant)
- 🧪 An **example PCB** for reference and learning


## ✨ Features

- 📘 Accurate and clean **schematic symbol**
- 📡 Footprint designed for SX1278 LoRa modules
- 🧩 Easy integration into KiCad projects
- 🛠️ Useful for prototyping and learning RF PCB design
- 📄 Example PCB included for reference
